Finally, I'm crossing the threshold 
From the ordinary world to the reveal of my heart 
Undoubtedly, that will for certain 
Take the dead out of the sea and the darkness from the arts

This is my commitment, my modern manifesto 
I'm doing it for all of us who never got the chance 
For, and for 
And all my birds of paradise
Who never got to fly at night
'Cause they were caught up in the dance

Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind 
I wanna get off, but I keep riding the ride 
I never really noticed that I had to decide 
To play someone's game, or live my own life 
And now I do 
I wanna move 
Out of the black (out of the black) 
Into the blue (into the blue)
